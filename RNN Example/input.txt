The String Quartet No. 14 in C♯ minor, Op. 131, was completed by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1826. It is the last-composed
of a trio of string quartets, written in the order op. 132, 130 (with the Große Fuge ending), 131.

It was Beethoven's favourite of the late quartets: he is quoted as remarking to a friend that he would find "a new
manner of part-writing and, thank God, less lack of imagination than before". It is said that upon listening to a
performance of this quartet, Schubert remarked, "After this, what is left for us to write?"[2] Robert Schumann said that
this quartet and Op. 127 had a "...grandeur [...] which no words can express. They seem to me to stand...on the extreme
boundary of all that has hitherto been attained by human art and imagination."

This work is dedicated to Baron Joseph von Stutterheim as a gesture of gratitude for taking his nephew, Karl, into the
army after a failed suicide attempt.
